    <string name="bio">Hello, my name is Amir.
\n\n  At the moment I am a student of Astana IT University. \nI am 18 years old, from Taraz. I studied at a rural school.
        \nTo tell the truth, earlier I was not interested in IT, and I made my choice to enter this specialty and university only in the 11th grade.
        But I am going to become a highly qualified specialist in the field of programming.
        <b>I set myself a goal and I will definitely achieve it!</b>
\n\n  In fact, I have a lot of hobbies. From early childhood, I started going to different sections.
And by this age I have visited many different sports, thanks to which
        I also visited many cities and met many interesting people, some of whom became very good friends.
I went to sections such as taekwondo, swimming, chess and basketball. Basketball is my favorite.
\n\n  Most of all I enjoy music, I love listening to music.
\Also my not-so-good side is that if I start playing or watching a movie/series itâ€™s hard for me to stop.
        \n\n<b>Thanks for reading!</b>
